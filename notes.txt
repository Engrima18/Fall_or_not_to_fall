Articles for fall detection with DEEP LEARNING:
>- the best article found!!!!!!!!!!!!!! --> https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/13/8/4988
>- techniques for better results---> applying data augmentation techniques: adding gaussian noise with standard deviation to the input sequence | scaling the original sequence by a random value in the range 0.7 and 1.1 (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169260719311770)
>- CNN+LSTM

# Plots:
>- adapt the plots from signle samples for each class to class plots with snsn mean and std
>- comparative plots of performaces of machine learing algortihms --> ROC curve, Precision-Recall curve, confusion matrix (or better report accuracy, sensitivity and specificity


# preporc and collection:
>- report the effective sampling frequency in Hz
>- speak about the WINDOW for signal processing
>- we have to say that we excluded the alpha degree (reported in this article: https://www.ijrte.org/wp-content/uploads/papers/v8i3/C3877098319.pdf) since we cannot assume a fixed orientation fo the device during data collection or in test phase
>- wavelets continuous transform
>- justify fft peaks
>- CWT coefficients with mother wavelet
>- also add the CALIBRATION problem and the assumption of bias exclusion w.r.t. mother wavelet
>- specify the number of people used to collect data and the number of examples with a brief view of data before preproc
>- report use cases and introduce possible applications (for example the video with air bag jacket)


# ML algorithms:
>- model agnostic feature importance
>- VIF and multicollinearity
>- clustering/KNN for classes evaluation
>- SVM and decision boundaries comparison of classifiers (maybe using PCA before to allow visulization)
>- ROC and precision-recall curves comparison of classifiers
>- calibration comparison of classifiers

# Further improvements:
>-  cross-dataset classifier for fall detection which is independent of the accelerometer device, the sampling rate or the length of the sequences.
