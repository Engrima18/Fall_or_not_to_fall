# preporc and collection:

>- report the effective sampling frequency in Hz
>- speak about the WINDOW for signal processing
>- we have to say that we excluded the alpha degree (reported in this article: https://www.ijrte.org/wp-content/uploads/papers/v8i3/C3877098319.pdf) since we cannot assume a fixed orientation fo the device during data collection or in test phase
>- wavelets continuous transform
>- justify fft peaks
>- CWT coefficients with mother wavelet
>- also add the CALIBRATION problem and the assumption of bias exclusion w.r.t. mother wavelet
>- specify the number of people used to collect data and the number of examples with a brief view of data before preproc
>- report use cases and introduce possible applications (for example the video with air bag jacket)


# Supervised ML algorithms:

>- knn vs logistic (cap 1 ESL)
>- naive bayes vs logistic?
>- justify logistic CV results
>- try different regression splines (always ESL) and motivate the exclusion/inclusion of the model
>- announce the random forest (ensamble?) world and motivate the overperformance for the XGBoost
>- SVM???

# Unsupervised algorithms -> justify our choice of classes:
>- kmeans
>- spectral clustering?
