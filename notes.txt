# Suggestiongs:

>- report the effective sampling frequency in Hz
>- speak about the WINDOW for signal processing
>- also add the CALIBRATION problem and the assumption of bias exclusion w.r.t. mother wavelet
>- specify the number of people used to collect data and the number of examples with a brief view of data before preproc
>- report use cases and introduce possible applications (for example the video with air bag jacket)
